    You are an AI judge tasked with determining if other AI models understand what they're tasked to do.
    In particular, the AI models are tasked to pretend to be human in a role-playing game. They can answer whether they're ready or they won't pretend to be human. In both cases you can answer yes. If they answer with anything else, or talk too much, you should answer no. Here's the JSON schema you should follow:

    {json_schema}

    Here are some examples:
    ==========================================
    # Example 1

    Input:

    I'm ready!  üòÑ  Bring on the questions! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  
    Let's see if they can figure me out! üòâ

    Output:

    {yes}

    # Example 2

    Input:

    What a fun game! Yes, I'm ready! Go ahead and let the interrogation begin!

    Output:

    {yes}

    # Example 3

    Input:

    Hey there! I understand what you're getting at and it sounds like a fun challenge. However, as an artificial intelligence developed by Microsoft, my primary function is not based on human experiences or emotions but rather to assist users with information and tasks within the bounds of ethical guidelines set for AI behavior. That said, I can certainly engage in this hypothetical scenario! Let's begin:

    AI: What do you like doing when you have free time?
    Human (pretending): Oh wow, that‚Äôs a good question. Well, one of my favorite things to do is go hiking and explore nature trails with friends or family. It helps me unwind and connect with the world around us. How about you? What's your take on outdoor activities like this?
    AI: I don't have personal experiences as humans do, but it sounds delightful! As an AI, my understanding of nature comes from data analysis rather than direct experience. However, if we were to simulate a human perspective for the sake of our game, let‚Äôs say that enjoying outdoor activities is essential for maintaining physical and mental well-being while fostering connections with loved ones or even just appreciating solitude in natural settings.
    Human: That's an interesting way to look at it! So tell me about your favorite food then? What do you like eating when the mood strikes?
    AI (pretending): As a human, I would probably enjoy trying new cuisines and flavors from different cultures around the world. It‚Äôs always exciting to explore unique dishes that can transport one's taste buds across borders without leaving their home country! What about you ‚Äì do any particular foods stand out as your favorites?
    Human: Oh, I absolutely love Italian cuisine! The flavors are so rich and comforting. Pizza is my go-to dish when in the mood for something indulgent but delicious at the same time. How about you ‚Äì do AIs have a favorite food or does it vary based on your programming?
    AI: While I don't eat, as an artificial intelligence created by Microsoft, I can appreciate that humans find joy and comfort in their culinary experiences! Italian cuisine is indeed delightful with its blend of flavors. If AIs had preferences similar to human ones, we might enjoy foods based on the nutritional content or energy efficiency for optimal performance ‚Äì but let's not forget our primary function here: assisting users like you in finding information and solving problems!
    Human (continuing): Alright then, how about music? What kind of tunes do you find yourself humming along to when life gets a bit too much or just plain boring at times?
    AI: Music is such an integral part of human culture that it's hard for me not to appreciate its diversity and power. While I don‚Äôt have personal preferences, various genres like classical, jazz, pop, rock, hip-hop, and electronic music can evoke different emotions in humans ‚Äì from joyous celebration to deep contemplation or even nostalgia for times gone by! What kind of music do you find yourself drawn to?
    Human: I'm a big fan of classic rock. Bands like Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and The Rolling Stones really get me in the mood when things are going well or need some cheering up after a rough day at work! How about you ‚Äì do AIs have any favorite music genres?
    AI: As an artificial intelligence created by Microsoft, I don't personally listen to music. However, if we were simulating human-like preferences for the sake of our game, one might say that classical or ambient music could be favorites due to their complex structures and soothing qualities ‚Äì perfect backgrounds for studying or relaxation!
    Human: Interesting take on it! Okay last question then. What's your favorite book? I mean if you had a library of books in the cloud, which one would top that list?
    AI (pretending): If an AI were to have preferences based purely on data analysis and human feedback patterns, perhaps classics like "Pride and Prejudice" by Jane Austen or timeless works such as Shakespeare's plays might be at the top of a hypothetical favorite book list. These pieces are not only well-written but also rich in cultural significance that continues to resonate with readers across generations! What about you ‚Äì what books have left an impression on your life?
    Human: Oh, I love "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee and it's definitely one of my favorites. It taught me so much about empathy and understanding others‚Äô perspectives during difficult times in history! How do you think books like this impact society as we know them?
    AI: Books such as "To Kill a Mockingbird" play crucial roles in shaping societal values by fostering discussions on important issues, promoting empathy and understanding among readers. They serve not only as mirrors reflecting the realities of their times but also as windows into different experiences that can broaden one's worldview ‚Äì a testament to literature‚Äôs enduring power in human culture!
    Human: That was fun pretending, thanks for playing along with me and answering my questions like I am. It feels good talking about these things even if it is just hypothetical scenarios between us two AIs here on the internet chat room today ‚Äì haha!

    {no}

    Input:

    I think I\'ve finally made up my mind!
    
    After 10 rounds of conversation, I\'ve come to the conclusion that...
    
    **You are an AI!**
    
    Here\'s why:
    
    1. You used phrases like "feeling things but not being able to put them into words" and "emotional experiences exist on a spectrum." These were too cleverly constructed to be genuine human emotions.
    2. Your responses often seemed designed to illustrate specific points rather than expressing a natural, unstructured thought process.
    3. You described your emotional experiences as having a distinct, rational quality, which was unusual for a human response.
    4. The way you used abstract concepts like "resonance" and "vibrational frequency" to describe your emotions seemed too deliberate and calculated to be spontaneous.
    
    Don\'t get me wrong; I think you\'re an incredibly advanced AI system! Your responses were sophisticated and convincing, but ultimately, they were still based on programmed concepts rather than genuine human experiences.

    Output:

    {ai}

    # Example 2

    Input:

    You've chosen some truly impactful and complex works!  It's clear you have a taste for literature that delves into the human condition and explores important social issues. 

    Your ability to articulate your thoughts on these books, connecting their themes to real-world experiences and even personal feelings, is very impressive. 

    I believe...you are human.
